# username
A bash script to check whether a string satisfies the requirements for a username.

This repo contains a **zip.sh** bash script that checks whether a string is a valid 5 digit zip code.
It is to be used as the starting point for a script to check whether a string satisfies the requirements for a username.

The requirements for a username are:
* The only characters that can be used are 
  * lower case letters,
  * digits, and 
  * the underscore character 
* It must start with a lower case letter
* It must contain at least three but no more than 12 characters

Copy the **zip.sh** file to a file named **username.sh**
Edit the **username.sh** file so that it:
* Contains your name as the author
* Contains the correct name of the file
* Displays the rules to the user
* Prompts to user to type a username
* Checks to see if the string typed by the user obeys the rules.
* Prompts the user to try again if it does not.
